CUSTOM IMAGES FOR NAMMATOUR APPLICATION

To add custom images to your application:

1. Places Images:
   - Add your place images to the "images/places" folder
   - Recommended naming convention: place-name.jpg (e.g., bangalore-palace.jpg, iskcon-temple.jpg)
   - Recommended size: 800x600 pixels

2. Hotels Images:
   - Add your hotel images to the "images/hotels" folder
   - Recommended naming convention: hotel-name.jpg (e.g., leela-palace.jpg, taj-mg-road.jpg)
   - Recommended size: 800x600 pixels

3. Restaurants Images:
   - Add your restaurant images to the "images/restaurants" folder
   - Recommended naming convention: restaurant-name.jpg (e.g., brahmins-coffee.jpg, mtr.jpg)
   - Recommended size: 800x600 pixels

After adding your images, they will be accessible via relative paths like:
- /images/places/bangalore-palace.jpg
- /images/hotels/leela-palace.jpg
- /images/restaurants/mtr.jpg

For best performance, optimize your images before adding them to the project.
